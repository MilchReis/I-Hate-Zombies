I Hate Zombies
==============

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MilchReis/I-Hate-Zombies/master/imgs/logo.png "Logo")

A simple HTML5 platformer game. Shoot, jump and stay alive. This project was build for trying out the [phaser](http://phaser.io/getting-started-js.php "phaser js") javascript library for 2D games. The small result is here now.


### Controls and Game ###

The controls are very simple. Use the `RIGHT` button for shooting and starting the game and the `UP` button for jumping around. The goal of the game is to stay alive so long as you can.


### Play it ###

The game runs good on modern browser. Even on mobile browsers it works great. Please wait a few seconds while the game is loading by the browser.

### Thanks ###

My special thanks goes to Arne Blumentritt for the great looking clouds, Jesse Freemann for the free human and zombie sprites and last but not least to nosoapradio.us and freesound.org for the free sounds.

I Hate Zombies
==============

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Milchreis/I-Hate-Zombies/master/imgs/logo.png "Logo")

A simple HTML5 platformer game. Shoot, jump and stay alive. This project was build to trying out the [phaser](http://phaser.io/getting-started-js.php "phaser js") javascript library for 2D games. The small result is here out now.


## Controls and Game ##

The controls are very simple. Use the `RIGHT` button for _shooting_ and _starting_ the game and the `UP` button for _jumping_ around. The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as you can.


## Play it ##

The game runs good on modern browsers. Even on mobile browsers it works great. Please wait a few seconds while the game is loading by the browser (page is completely black).

I Hate Zombies
==============

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MilchReis/I-Hate-Zombies/master/imgs/logo.png "Logo")

A simple platformer game for HTML5. This project is an approach to try and evaluate the [phaser javascript library](http://phaser.io/getting-started-js.php "phaser js") for 2D games.


Controls and Game
========

The controls are very simple. Use `RIGHT` for shooting and starting the game and `UP` for jumping. The goal is to stay alive so long as you can.


Play it
=======

The game runs good on modern browser. Even on the mobile browsers works great.

Thanks
========

My special thanks goes to Arne Blumentritt for the great looking clouds, Jesse Freemann for the free human and zombie sprites and last but not least to nosoapradio.us and freesound.org for the free sounds.
